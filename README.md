# Beat Saber Converter
Unzips downloaded beat saber maps and names the folder with the song name. 

 Searches the current directory for all files ending in '.zip'. It unzips the archive, and attempts to name the resulting folder with the name of the song and its artist. 
 
 No real error handling or anything, mostly just a personal project.
